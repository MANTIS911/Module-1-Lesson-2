<p>The <em>mantis</em>, or praying <b>mantis</b>, is a fascinating insect known for its unique appearance and predatory behavior. Named for
its prominent front legs, which are bent and held together as if in prayer, the <b>mantis</b> is an iconic insect that has
captured the imagination of many cultures worldwide. Its front legs are not just for show; they are highly adapted for
catching prey. The <b>mantis</b> is a carnivorous insect, feeding on a wide range of other insects and sometimes even small
vertebrates, such as frogs or birds. With its keen eyesight and lightning-fast reflexes, it can detect and snatch prey
with remarkable precision. A characteristic feature of the <em>Mantis</em> is its triangular head, which sits on a flexible neck,
allowing it to turn its head almost 180 degrees. This ability to look over its shoulder makes the mantis a highly
effective hunter, giving it an edge in spotting potential prey or predators.
<br/>
<br />
Mantises are primarily solitary creatures, engaging with one another only during mating season. In some species, the
female <b>mantis</b> has been observed engaging in sexual cannibalism, where she may consume the male after or even during
mating. This behavior, while gruesome to humans, is a natural part of the <strong><i>Mantis's</i></strong> reproductive strategy and helps
provide the female with extra nutrients needed to support the development of her eggs. After mating, the female lays her
eggs in a foam-like substance that hardens into a protective case called an ootheca, which can contain up to several
hundred eggs. These eggs remain in the ootheca until they hatch, and the baby <strong>Mantises</strong>, known as nymphs, emerge. Nymphs
resemble miniature versions of adults but lack fully developed wings and reproductive organs. As they grow, they molt
multiple times, shedding their exoskeleton until they reach full maturity.
<br />
<br />
One of the most remarkable aspects of the <b>mantis</b> is its vision. Unlike many other insects, the mantis has stereo vision,
meaning it can perceive depth, which is crucial for hunting. It has two large compound eyes that are capable of
detecting movement from a distance. The <strong>mantis's</strong> eyes are so sensitive that it can see in three dimensions, allowing it
to accurately judge the distance to its prey. In addition to its excellent vision, the mantis also has specialized
hearing.<mark></mark> Despite lacking traditional ears, it has an auditory structure located on its abdomen that allows it to detect</mark>
the ultrasonic sounds made by predatory bats, enabling it to take evasive action in mid-flight.</p>

    Keyboards are one of the most essential and ubiquitous tools in modern technology, playing a pivotal role in how people
    interact with computers, smartphones, tablets, and other devices. At their core, keyboards are input devices that allow
    users to communicate with machines through a series of key presses. The standard QWERTY keyboard layout, named for the
    first six letters in the upper-left corner, is the most common format used worldwide. This layout was initially designed
    for typewriters in the 19th century by Christopher Sholes to prevent the mechanical arms of typewriters from jamming.
    Though typewriters are now obsolete, this layout remains the most familiar and widely used format for digital keyboards,
    even though there are many alternatives that aim to improve typing efficiency and ergonomics.

   Keyboards come in various forms, from mechanical keyboards to membrane keyboards, and even virtual ones that appear on
    touchscreen devices. Mechanical keyboards, prized for their durability and tactile feedback, utilize individual
    mechanical switches for each key. These switches provide a distinct "clicky" sound and a more responsive typing
    experience, making them popular among typists and gamers alike. On the other hand, membrane keyboards, which are more
    common in modern laptops and budget desktop setups, have a much quieter operation and use a pressure pad system to
    register key presses. Although less expensive to produce, membrane keyboards often lack the tactile feedback of
    mechanical ones, which can make them less comfortable for long-term use. Virtual keyboards, which appear on screens,
    such as those on smartphones or tablets, use touch-based input and have become an integral part of mobile computing.</del>
    <br>
    <br>
    Over the years, keyboard technology has evolved significantly, leading to various improvements and innovations designed
    to enhance the user experience. Ergonomic keyboards, for example, are designed to reduce strain on the hands and wrists,
    helping to prevent repetitive strain injuries (RSIs) like carpal tunnel syndrome. These keyboards often feature a split
    design, where the keys are angled to more naturally align with the user's hands. This design encourages a more neutral
    wrist position, which can alleviate the discomfort associated with prolonged typing. Some ergonomic models even include
    built-in wrist rests or adjustable tenting mechanisms that allow users to customize the angle of the keyboard to suit
    their comfort level.
